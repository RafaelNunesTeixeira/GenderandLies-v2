            <p> In the following tasks, you will be asked to describe your opinion on the other participants' perceptions. </p>
            <p> Your goal is to guess the <strong>average opinion of the participants taking part in this experiment</strong>.</p>

            <p>For example:</p>
            <p>You will be asked: "How appropriate do others think that the following behavior is on a scale from 1 to 5"</p>
            <p>We will measure the <strong>average answer of all participants on each question to determine the correct answer</strong>.</p>
             <p>The closer your answer is to the average answer, the higher your earnings. 200 points are subtracted from the initial 250 points for each unit your guess departs from the actual answer (it is not possible to lose money).</p>
               <p>That is, if the average answer of all participants were "X" and your answer is "X+1", you will earn 50 extra points if this question was the one randomly selected.</p>
             <p> Remember, we will randomly select one question from parts 1 and 2 according to which you will be paid out.</p>
