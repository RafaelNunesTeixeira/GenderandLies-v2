    In the following tasks, you are asked to describe your beliefs about the participants 1 on the previous task. We will describe the features of the participants you will evaluate. Pay attention to that information.
</p>
            <p> To determine the correct answer, we will measure the average decisions of all participants 1 that fit your reported description.  </p>

            <p> The closer your answer is to the average decision of all participants 1 the higher your payoff. </p>


            <p> A correct answer is rewarded with 250 points. 20 points are subtracted from these 250 points for each unit your answer departs from the average decision.</p>
            <p> That is, if the average behavior is "X", and your guess is "X+2"; you will earn 210 extra points if this question was the one randomly selected.</p>
